Space rock 'on collision course'

=20
An asteroid could devastate Earth

     =20
     =20
      By Dr David Whitehouse=20
      BBC News Online science editor =20
    =20
    =20
An asteroid discovered just weeks ago has become the most threatening =
object yet detected in space.=20
A preliminary orbit suggests that 2002 NT7 is on an impact course with =
Earth and could strike the planet on 1 February, 2019 - although the =
uncertainties are large.=20

Astronomers have given the object a rating on the so-called Palermo =
technical scale of threat of 0.06, making NT7 the first object to be =
given a positive value.=20

>>From its brightness, astronomers estimate it is about two kilometres =
wide, large enough to cause continent-wide devastation on Earth.=20

Many observations=20

Although astronomers say the object definitely merits attention, they =
expect more observations to show it is not on an Earth-intersecting =
trajectory.=20



      This asteroid has now become the most threatening object in the =
short history of asteroid detection=20
    =20
      Dr Benny Peiser =20
It was first seen on the night of 5 July, picked up by the Linear =
Observatory's automated sky survey programme in New Mexico, US.=20

Since then astronomers worldwide have been paying close attention to it, =
amassing almost 200 observations in a few weeks.=20


Could it be deflected?=20
Dr Benny Peiser, of Liverpool John Moores University in the UK, told BBC =
News Online that "this asteroid has now become the most threatening =
object in the short history of asteroid detection".=20

NT7 circles the Sun every 837 days and travels in a tilted orbit from =
about the distance of Mars to just within the Earth's orbit.=20

Potential devastation=20

Detailed calculations of NT7's orbit suggest many occasions when its =
projected path through space intersects the Earth's orbit.=20

Researchers estimate that on 1 February, 2019, its impact velocity on =
the Earth would be 28 km a second - enough to wipe out a continent and =
cause global climate changes.=20

However, Dr Peiser was keen to point out that future observations could =
change the situation.=20

He said: "This unique event should not diminish the fact that additional =
observations in coming weeks will almost certainly - we hope - eliminate =
the current threat."=20

Easily observable=20

According to astronomers, NT7 will be easily observable for the next 18 =
months or so, meaning there is no risk of losing the object.=20

Observations made over that period - and the fact that NT7 is bright =
enough that it is bound to show up in old photographs - mean that =
scientists will soon have a very precise orbit for the object.=20

Dr Donald Yeomans, of the US space agency's (Nasa) Jet Propulsion =
Laboratory in California, told BBC News Online: "The orbit of this =
object is rather highly inclined to the Earth's orbit so it has been =
missed because until recently observers were not looking for such =
objects in that region of space."=20

Regarding the possibility of an impact, Dr Yeomans said the =
uncertainties were large.=20

"The error in our knowledge of where NT7 will be on 1 February, 2019, is =
large, several tens of millions of kilometres," he said.=20

Dr Yeomans said the world would have to get used to finding more objects =
like NT7 that, on discovery, look threatening, but then become harmless. =


"This is because the problem of Near-Earth Objects is now being properly =
addressed," he said.=20
